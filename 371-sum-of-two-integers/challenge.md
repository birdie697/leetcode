Calculate the sum of two integers a and b, but you are not allowed to use the operator + and -.

Example 1:

Input: a = 1, b = 2
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: a = -2, b = 3
Output: 1


I got this to work with the provided example, but it times out or runs out of
memory when the code is submitted as a solution.  It fails the 12th out of 13
test.  Boo.  

Reading through the discussion, I see a lot of getSum(a,b).  I thought that the
goal was not to use that or + or -.  I'm confused have spent too much time on
this.
